                A full stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. In addition to
                mastering HTML and CSS, he/she also knows how to: Program a browser (like using JavaScript, jQuery,
                Angular, or Vue) Program a server (like using PHP, ASP, Python, or Node) Program a database (like using
                SQL, SQLite, or MongoDB)

                Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
                The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the
                front end of a website change constantly.
